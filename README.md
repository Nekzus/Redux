# Redux
> A simple Discord bot project programmed in Lua.

This project has been made public. Feel free to take whatever you want to develope your own bot.
I've attempted to create a bot for small servers that relies on Lua mostly, so it has data-base-like functions purely in Lua.
Any personal information still present in the bot no longer works, such as tokens and stuff, so don't worry about warning me.

## Dependencies
- [Luvit](https://luvit.io/)
- [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia/)
- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) (ensure integration with cmd on options)

### Milestones
- [x] Pure-Lua database
- [x] Proper logic for commands management
- [x] Dynamic access to tables for making access easier
